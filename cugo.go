// Unix utilities as a multi-call binary
//
// `cugo` provides common Unix core utilities in the form of a multi-call
// binary, with a focus on broad support for various Unix and Unix-like
// operating systems.
//
// Cugo was inspired by Rob Landley's `toybox` project with a goal of
// using Go, which allows for a much simpler build system. Go's standard
// library is feature complete enough to make many utilities trivial to
// implement, sometimes with little more than writing glue code as a
// wrapper for existing functionality.

	if err := cmd.Command.Parse(os.Args[1:]); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
