This namespace exists to separate the source code of each utility so
that they may be individually included into third-party projects. If you
would like to import a specific utility, you may do so from it's folder
as show in the following example:

    github.com/jcmdln/cugo/src/mkdir

For more information about each utility, please visit
https://godoc.org/github.com/jcmdln/cugo/src which also refers to the
primary Go standard library components used as well as the reference
manuals used to define the utility.
